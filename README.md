# Automated error correction system for English learner texts
In this repository we present some means to reproduce the training of the model in our qualification paper, as well as present some results that it has yield and (hopefully, in the future) open-source the code of the website the model is running at. We will add the requirements for the website as we set it up; for now, all the additional packages are listed in the notebooks in the notebooks folder, which we suggest to run on Google Colaboratory backends.

### TO-DO

- [x] Add notebooks to reproduce the results (03/06)
- [x] Add text correction examples (03/06)
- [ ] Deploy and add web app code
